/*
- [x] In `App.js` (or where ever you wanted to fetch the data) add state for the data you'll be getting from NASA.
- [x] Add an effect hook to handle the API call side effect.
- [x] Go to the [NASA APOD API docs](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) and read through the docs to see how to make the API call.
- [x] You don't _need_ an API key. However you may need one if you exceed the API request limits.
- [x] Using the endpoint given, fetch the data using `axios`.
- [x] In your `.then()` make sure to `console.log` the response so you can look at the shape of the data. ðŸ˜ƒ
- [x] Before you add your data to state, make sure your effect hook has a dependency array (probably empty, since we don't want this effect synced up to any state/props), otherwise you will start an **infinite loop, and you will exceed the API rate limits of the DEMO_KEY and need to use a real API_KEY.**
